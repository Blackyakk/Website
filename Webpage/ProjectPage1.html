                                    <p> The Therapy Tipi is a portable space designed for users with autism or other neurodivergent conditions. The Therapy Tipi offers a nuteral space for users to partake in Multisensory Therapy in any enviorment.</p>

                                        For this project we really wanted to understand as much about the users as possible as well as multisensory therapy and its benefits. Our client was St. John of Gods Hospital in Dublin. We were able to talk to nurses and other employees about their residents, their conditions and some of the pain points they had identified.

                                        We were also able to have in interview with the founder of Autism Ireland who was able to give great insights to some of the more hidden challenges that we should consider when designing for a nuerodivergent inavidual.

                                        <p> We follwed a typical process which began with research and brainstorming, then we moved to ideation, concept generation and so on. We landed on the idea of the Therapy Tipi when we realised that residents weren't able to use shared spaces during Covid. The Tipi would therfor be a space and sensory nutral space to practice their sensory therapy indavidually. </p>

                                        <h2 id=Process> Final </h2>

                                        <p> The final design allowed for users to fold the Tipi up for transportation, making it simple to take anywhere,even outside. The inside was lined with velcro panels where different sensory stimuli could be secured. This allowed for a unique and customisable expereince.</p>
