                                    <p> Washing machines are the biggest contributor of microplastic polution in our oceans. The Filter Aid is an internal filter that catches large microplastics and increases the lifespan on your washing machine.</p>

                                        On acerage we eat 5 grams of microplastics each week. Over the course of a year that is about 52 credit cards worth. A majority of this plastic comes from our washing machine, specificly our synthetic clothes. While new regulations and legislation will be released in the coming years we knew we needed to do something about it sooner.

                                        <p>Our focus in the beginning was on benchmarking existing products and solutions. We were able to find that most options on the market were external filters that could be attached to your machine. These were often large and exoensive. There were very few internal solutions and we felt we could improve on their design. </p>

                                        <p> Our final design was an internal filter that users would place inside the drum of their machine to catch large microplastic strands. This system makes it easy for users to catch and collect microplastics as well as reduces that load on their built in filters and decresing the amount of time needed between maintanence </p>
