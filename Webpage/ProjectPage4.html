                                <p> As part of my internship in Snigel Design I designed a multifuntional pouch as part of their wide range of attachments for military rigs.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    The breif for this project was very simple as it was basically a redesign on existing products from Snigels current range. However, I still went through sevral interations and prototypes while developing the pouch.

                                    <p> As mentioned, I went through several designs. These variations focused mainly on form and placment on the users rig. The pouch should be easily accessable and versitile. The pouch is attached to the rig using the Molle system, which is used by most contries around the world. The Mollse system consists of straps and loops. The accessories straps are woven throug the rigs loops and secured at the bottom. This allows for different accessories to be mounted almost anywhere on any rig.

                                        I used thin plastic in the lining of the pouch to give it structure and support. This ment the zip wouldnt buckle or fold when being zipped or unzipped.</p>

                                    <h2 id=Process> Final </h2>

                                    <p> The final solution was a simple but well resolved pouch. </p>
