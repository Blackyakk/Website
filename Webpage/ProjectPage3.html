                                    <p> This 400% scale lego minifigure was an oportunity for us to explore model making and prototyping with a variety of machines and methods.</p>

                                        Our focus for this project was on learning how to prototype using different machines. The machines and methods we would be using included; Laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC machining, vacume forming and resin casting.

                                        <p>The process of making the Maxifig was fairly straight forward as we knew which methods to use for each part of it. For example the torso was to be made from a laser cut armature and they incased in a vacum formed body. </p>

                                        <p> When the model was assembeled we sanded each part down, filled the gaps with body filler and primer then painted the models. I painted mine to ressemble Darth Maul from Star Wars.</p>
